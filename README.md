# Hi, I’m Christian Pierre Sibarani 👋 

I am a prospective **Statistics researcher** specializing in **nonstationary time-series analysis**, **extreme value modeling**, and **Bayesian uncertainty quantification**. My work focuses on developing **regime-aware, uncertainty-sensitive statistical frameworks** (ChrisHAMR: *Hierarchical Analysis and Modeling of Risk*) for complex real-world systems, ranging from financial dynamics to survival processes.

My background bridges **Management and Finance foundations** with **rigorous computational and methodological statistics**, emphasizing interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility.

## 🧪 Featured Research Projects (v1.0 Releases)

- **[Dynamic Financial Risk Modeling under Regime Shifts](https://github.com/ChrisHAMR/dynamic-financial-risk-modeling)** Integrated analysis combining GJR-GARCH volatility models, Extreme Value Theory (POT–GPD), time–frequency methods (STFT as a SLEX-inspired localization tool), and Bayesian inference to **analyze** nonstationary risk dynamics and regime behavior in financial time series.

- **[Himalayan Expeditions — Survival Analysis Case Study](https://github.com/ChrisHAMR/himalayan-expeditions-research)** End-to-end statistical analysis of expedition data with right-censoring, applying Kaplan–Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models to study termination risk and nonstationary uncertainty across seasons and expedition characteristics.

- **[Undergraduate Thesis — Python Reconstruction & Robustness Analysis](https://github.com/ChrisHAMR/undergraduate-thesis-python)** Reproduction and methodological extension of an SPSS-based regression study using Python, incorporating heteroskedasticity-robust inference, multicollinearity diagnostics, and penalized regression (Ridge and Lasso) to assess model stability under uncertainty.

- **[Monte Carlo Coin Toss Simulation — Probability Foundations](https://github.com/ChrisHAMR/coin-toss-simulation)** Simulation-based exploration of probability estimation, convergence, sampling distributions, and rare-event behavior, designed to build probabilistic intuition relevant to Bayesian and simulation-based inference.
